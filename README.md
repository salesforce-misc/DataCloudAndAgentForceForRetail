**Outfitters**</br> 
=======================
Welcome to Outfitters, a sample retail application. Outfitters is a fictional resort that uses Agentforce, the power of Data Cloud, and the Salesforce Platform to deliver highly personalized guest experiences. Explore ways to bring agents into business workflows, including new smart By capabilities, Search Property, content generation.

Did you watch the demo? The following are a set of instructions to setup the end to end demo in your own environment. While the end to end demo supports multiple clouds, you have full flexibility to use only the portions relevant to what you want to try out in your own org, additionally once the packages are installed you have the ability to fully customize it based on your needs. 

The Outfitters app showcases how with **Data Cloud** we have a true Customer 360 that then drives the right and best experience with Agentforce **Agents**.

  ## 1. Pre-Deployment Instructions 
</summary>

 4 step process
### 1. Salesforce Org Setup Requirements for Retail App
 **Option 1:** To support the Retail app, you can either create a new Salesforce Org or use an existing one, provided it includes the following features and licenses: 

  | Requirement | Details |
  | ----- | ----- |
  | Licenses Required | - Data Cloud</br>- Sales Cloud</br>- Service Cloud</br>- Experience</br>- Commerce Cloud</br>- Personalization</br>-Einstein Agent</br>- Marketing Cloud</br>- MuleSoft (Optional)
  | Features Required | - Service Agent</br>- Einstein Agent</br>- Copilot</br>- Prompt Builder</br>- Agent Force</br>- Real-time(Additional SKU)</br>- Code Builder (Optional) 
  | Permission Set Licenses Required | - Agentforce Service Agent User</br>- Tableau Next Creator</br>- Personalization
  
  Our package is designed to support all these clouds, but you have full flexibility to use only the portions relevant to your business. If you are not using a particular cloud (e.g., Loyalty 
  Cloud), you can simply skip its configuration—the package will still install successfully, but that feature will not be available until you configure it yourself. Additionally, you can customize 
  and enhance the existing package by adding your own features as needed. <br/>
  
 ⚠️ **Important Note:** Existing Trailheads playgrounds cannot be used

   **Option 2:** To ensure a seamless integration and unlock a 360-degree view of customer interactions, we recommend enabling Salesforce Foundations in your org. This free enhancement integrates Sales, Service, Marketing, Commerce, and Data Cloud functionalities, improving efficiency and AI-readiness.

**How to Enable Salesforce Foundations:**
- Log in to your Salesforce instance.
- Navigate to Setup → Search for Salesforce Foundations.
- Click "Add to My Contract" (It's free).
- Select the Foundations products and proceed with checkout.
- Return to Setup and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the configuration.<br/>
🔗 More details: [Salesforce Foundations](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/foundations)

**External Connections:** The app showcases the use of structured and unstructured data ingested from AWS and the use of zero-copy with Snowflake. This section talks about the connectivity you would need for those use cases.
| **Connection** | **Details** |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Amazon S3** $${\color{blue} Optional}$$ <br> Used to bring in structured and unstructured data. Unstructured data powers Agent conversations in this setup. | **NOTE:** If you do not have an existing Amazon S3 instance, [register for the free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) and follow [this guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2023/10/how-to-use-the-amazon-s3-storage-connector-in-data-cloud) to create a dedicated user with required permissions. <br><br>Already have an S3 instance? No need to sign up again. <br><br>Before proceeding, note your [programmatic credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key). |
| **Snowflake** $${\color{blue}Optional}$$ <br> Used to showcase Data Cloud’s Zero Copy capabilities. | **NOTE:** If you do not have access to a Snowflake instance, follow [this article](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2024/08/zero-copy-data-federation-with-snowflake-and-salesforce-data-cloud) to create a Warehouse, Integration User, and configure and note public/private keys that you will use with Salesforce Data Cloud.<br><br> |
